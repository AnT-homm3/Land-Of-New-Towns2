* see file "...\Mods\Land Of New Towns\Data\s\___options.erm" to edit user settings

* The default homm3 town selection (Castle,Rampart...Conflux) before map generation affects the terrain around the starting town.   For example, for Knigh's Castle it is better to select "Castle town", for "Forest town" select "Rampart".

* On the mod homepage (https://sites.google.com/view/landofnewtowns)  you can download high-res textures for standart homm3 towns (Castle, Rampart... Conflux) and some map objects
