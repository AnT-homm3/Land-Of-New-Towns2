2.0
The new version support for adding new towns (adding as new ones, not replacing as it was done before). The total number of towns became 11. All this was done by using ERM scripts.
To play for new towns choose their base on start (Rampart==Eldorado, Dungeon==ShadowTown, Stronghold==SandTown). New towns generated randomly - default town or new town. For example, If you want to play ShadowTown  - choose Dungeon on start. If ShadowTown does not appear (appear Dungeon) - simple restart scenario.
Known bugs/features
- Small icons of towns not supported 
- supported maps from L size and the number of towns 8 
- In town switching dialog, the background and dwellings do not change. (If you enter the town separately by clicking on town or entering by hero - all working)
